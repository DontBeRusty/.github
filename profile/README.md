## What We Build

| Repo | Stack | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| [NotRustyApp](https://github.com/DontBeRusty/NotRustyApp) | Kotlin · Jetpack Compose | Modern Android app — clean architecture, modular design, full-featured. Definitely not Rust. |
| [RustyButTrusty](https://github.com/DontBeRusty/RustyButTrusty) | Rust · Axum · SQLx | Lightweight REST API for auth and transaction tracking. We lied. It's Rust. |
| [NotRustyEither](https://github.com/DontBeRusty/NotRustyEither) | Go · Gin · Postgres · Redis | TikTok at home. Live streaming platform with S3/local storage. Not Rust. We promise. |
